- implement a separated-thread behavior for it.rhai.simulation.* routines, in order to ensure a correct computation in critical situations (long delays in abstraction / identification)

- implement a DoubleBuffer<T> in it.rhai.util. Let it.rhai.simulation handlers use this stack to avoid missing data
